  <!-- 
    
   Post processes the resolve map (output of the mappull preprocess step)
   in order to add additional copy-to values in order to ensure unique
   result files for all references to a given topic or to impose additional
   output filenaming rules, such as using navigation keys for result filenames.
   
   This process should be run between the mappull and chunk steps of the normal
   OT preprocess sequence.
