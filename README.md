org.dita-community.process-map-first
====================================

Rearchitects the Open Toolkit preprocessing pipeline
to do all map processing first, then do processing
of topics to resolve conrefs, apply filtering,
and create temporary topic files reflecting any
copy-to and chunking defined in the map.

Depends on the org.dita-community.adjust-copy-to plugin <https://github.com/dita-community/org.dita-community.adjust-copy-to>
